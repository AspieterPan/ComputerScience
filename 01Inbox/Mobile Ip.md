- [[home agent]] 
	- stores information about mobile nodes whose permanent home address is in the home agent's network. The [[home agent|HA]] acts as a router on a [[mobile host]]'s (MH) home network which tunnels datagrams for delivery to the [[mobile host|MH]] when it is away from home, maintains a location directory (LD) for the [[mobile host|MH]].
- [[foreign agent]]
	- stores information about mobile nodes visiting its network. Foreign agents also advertise care-of addresses, which are used by [[Mobile IP]]. if there  is no foreign agent in the host network, the mobile device has to take care of getting an address and advertising that address by its own means. The Fa acts as a router on a MH's visited network which provides routing sevices to the MH while registered. FA tunnels and delivers datagrams to the MH that were tunneled by the MH's HA
